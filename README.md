### What I learned

Completing the Single Price Grid Component challenge from Frontendmentor.io was a pivotal learning experience for me. It enabled me to delve into the intricacies of responsive design and effectively translate a Figma design into HTML & CSS code. This challenge not only honed my technical skills but also taught me how to think responsively while crafting designs. I'm grateful for the opportunity to grow through this project.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I am transitioning towards building all of my websites using the React JavaScript Library, while adhering to the Google Material Design principles. This shift enables me to leverage the powerful capabilities of React for efficient development, while also ensuring that my designs align with the established usability and aesthetic standards advocated by Google's Material Design principles.
